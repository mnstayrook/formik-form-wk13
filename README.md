# Title: Formik Form Exercise

_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

Description:
Maegan had to create a form based off a Formik template. She created a simple one where you are required to use an email login and password.

How to Run:
PLEASE NOTE: This was run through React, so you may have to download files and run npm install into the directory.
 
Load page. Login with email and password; error messages will pop up if you do not use an email or try to skip. This form is merely to show how to use the form; it does not navigate anywhere.

Roadmap:
None at this time for this particular project.
